## Hi there 👋
> NWNEE Sam's Server - Menzoberranzan Overhaul/upgrade

Menzoberranzan, a multiplayer community build mod(server), was first launched in  2002 and built by [Sam Pullara](https://sampullara.com) [@spullara](https://github.com/spullara), with just 13 areas but with a core of one of the first pws at the time, and was integrated with Groovy!. 22 years later and several GM's/hosts/dm teams later, (and some time off with good behavior) - 'Menzo' relaunched 03/2024 after 12 years of silence.. and an entirely new edition of NWN (NWNEE) - the framework had been added to, changed, broke, etc to the point were making heads or tails of where to start was basically impossible. intergrating EE along with nwnxee and nwsync was alot more than first thought. 

Currently, the running mod (Menzoberranzan CEP27 Alpha11) stripped most of the mod's old files/scripts and was built with the dmfi's EE/CEP2.7 pws system.. but were not using nwnx2 and  should be.. and so -- we have hundreds of areas/items/npcs/encounters etc that we want to keep of course, but getting events and subraces and proper xp , level spawns, and my personal favorite active pws journals /quests (its more complicated than that) -
